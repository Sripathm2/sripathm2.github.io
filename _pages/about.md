## Current Research

**Intrusion Detection for UAV Networks** *(Jan 2025 - Present)*  
Building scalable, generalizable, and adaptive intrusion detection for dynamic UAV networks using machine learning, retrieval-augmented methods, and federated learning.

## Previous Research Experience

**Network Traffic Classification** *(Jan 2023 - Jan 2025)*  
Enabled network traffic classification using topological data analysis and developed a large scale network traffic generator to highlight limits in current network traffic classifiers.

**Multi-stream Network Analytics** *(Jan 2022 - Jan 2023)*  
Enabled multi-stream network analytics using a near-switch architecture to increase accuracy and reduce the reaction time of network telemetry systems.

**Graph Neural Networks for Bug Prediction** *(Mar 2021 - Dec 2021)*  
Developed a GNN model to predict bug location in python Github projects using python code AST and text data from GitHub issues.

**Camera Network Analysis** *(Jan 2018 - May 2020)*  
Led a team to develop tools for automated discovery of real-time network camera data from heterogeneous web pages, camera feed health checker, image database, and a camera database API with the client.
