            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>A Senior in Computer Science in Purdue University, USA. A person who loves to learn new things no matter what the subject is. I never trust a theory before analyzing and applying it in real life (if applicable). I believe in hard work, perfection and I strive hard to achieve them even if the work is easy. A swimmer, tennis player, and a vivid reader. If I were to be asked to describe myself in one word, it would be VERSATILE.</p>
            <p>My motto is "Never stop improving and learning." With this, I plunged into the waters of Computer science. To learn and create new things.</p>

                      Description:
                      Fiesta is a web app. Organizing a party is not a simple task and takes a lot of planning. Everyone the host invites would inevitably bring gifts to the party, 
                      but the host will have to give away the gift if it is a duplicate or it is something they don’t want to use. As a solution to this problem and to streamline 
                      the party hosting process, Fiesta would make the process of planning a party easier. With features like creating a guest list, sending invites, 
                      finding a place to host the party, catering services depending on the type of party it is and the host’s budget, Fiesta aims to make your celebration unique. 
                      Fiesta allows the host to make an Amazon Wishlist and share it with everyone invited. Invited guests can decide what to gift from the wish list, 
                      they can RSVP through the web app and get directions to the party location. Hence Fiesta is a one-stop party app.

                      which is a great way to pull up all your "study notes" or "recipes" with a couple of clicks of the mouse. We have been studying and 
                      applying the best user experience in our work.

                      nutrition. This would allow the user to try new and healthier food items. If the user does not have the ingredients. then the user has the option to 
                      have them added to a day They can view the aggregate amounts of consumptions of different ingredients and some suggestions related to their diets.

                      Description:
                      Foil maker is a game played between 2 or more people. The game flows as a question is given to all the players and each of them suggest a 
                      possible answer (but not the correct one). The computer shuffles all the answers and adds them along with the correct answer to the list of choices. 
                      This list is presented to all the players and their options are taken. The result is calculated upon the number of players one is successful in 
                      fooling and for getting the correct answer.
                      Server - it is the main controller which controls the flow of game. it implements threads and hence a new object is created for each new player. 
                      The input method does the main task of reading computing and presenting the result. All the player's ids are stored in two array lists for ensuring concurrency.
                      Client - it is the part of code which every player has while playing. It follows MVC format in which every java code has its own model, view and controller. 
                      Model is implemented by the method call; view is defined in the constructor and the controller is given to call1 method.

              <p><h4>Details:</h4>
                The current project is centralizing and allowing access to a database containing camera feeds around the globe. 
                My team has completed working on an REST API to allow access to the Database. In addition to that we have created a 
                client in python which allows successful interaction with the API. We created scripts to check the health and accuracy 
                of the camera feed.  After this we shifted our focus towards experiments to create a generalized solution to classify 
                if a web page contains camera data and if it does, we will extract the information of the camera and add to it out 
                database. On the side we are working towards an image database which will allow the user to search for camera feed 
                for objects in near real time.
                My area of Contribution will be in ensuring that the CameraDatabaseAPI and the Camera Database Client are up to date 
                and fast and efficient. My team and I would be constantly being working on these two child projects to keep them spick 
                and span. Along with this, my team and I would be working on the health checking scripts. We will be using different 
                techniques to determine the location of the camera, framerate of the camera along with resolution width and height. 
                But, most importantly we will determine if images are retrievable from the camera feeds. We will also be marking the 
                unhealthy cameras so that API users do not get bad data. We will try to automate the process of fixing unhealthy cameras.
                We will also generate two solutions which can be used to classify a webpage, extract camera information and allow the user 
                to search for camera feed for objects in near real time.
