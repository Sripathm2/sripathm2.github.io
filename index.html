            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>A Master's student in Computer Science at University of California, Los Angeles, USA. A person who loves to learn new things no matter what the subject is. I never trust a theory before analyzing and applying it in real life (if applicable). I believe in hard work, perfection and I strive hard to achieve them even if the work is easy. A swimmer, tennis player, and avid reader. If I were to be asked to describe myself in one word, it would be VERSATILE.</p>
            <p>My motto is "Never stop improving and learning." With this, I plunged into the waters of Computer science. To learn and create new things.</p>

            <p><h4>Continuous Analysis of Many Cameras, Purdue University :</h4>
            Our aim was in centralizing and allowing access to a database containing camera feeds around the globe.
            My team has completed working on an REST API to allow access to the Database. In addition to that we have created a
            client in python which allows successful interaction with the API. We created scripts to check the health and accuracy
            of the camera feed.  After this we shifted our focus towards experiments to create a generalized solution to classify
            if a web page contains camera data and if it does, we extracted the information of the camera and add to it our
            database. We also created an image database which will allow the user to search for camera feed
            for objects in near real time.

                      Name	: A Survey of Graph Neural Networks for Programming Languages
                      <br>
                      Description:
                      Research at the intersection of Programming Languages, Deep Learning and Graph Neural Networks has
                      been rapidly evolving over the past few years. Deep Learning and Graph Neural Network techniques
                      has shown tremendous progress and potential across a variety of sub domains in Programming Languages.
                      Our goal with this paper is to survey the rise of Neural techniques and the integration and use
                      of Graph Neural Networks in these techniques, spanning some interesting subdomains. We also point
                      the users towards a common benchmark across Programming Languages and NLP and present ideas on
                      generalized representation learning of Code using GNNs.

                      Name	: Dynamic GNN for forecasting COVID-19 pandemic spread in United states
                      <br>
                      Description:
                      Our objective is to design a dynamic graph neural network which fore-casts the Covid-19 pandemic
                      spread inside the United States. We will approach this problem by building a graphG= (V,E) where
                      the set V contains nodes representing places (e.g. cities, counties, states) while the set E
                      contains edges representing relationships between the nodes. These relationships static or
                      dynamic. Static edges could be defined an edge between city and county that the city is part of
                      or two counties that share borders. Dynamic edges could be defined by time dependent data like
                      human mobility between two states. The space and time dependent nature of a pandemic requires us
                      to capture the temporal and spatial features that contributes to the spread. We need to come up
                      with a model than can reconcile these spatial and temporal features to forecast the count of
                      infections at each granularity levels(cities, counties, states). Dynamic graph neural networks are
                      explored as a possible approach to make these forecasts.

                      Description:
                      Fiesta is a web app. Organizing a party is not a simple task and takes a lot of planning. Everyone the host invites would inevitably bring gifts to the party, 
                      but the host will have to give away the gift if it is a duplicate or it is something they don’t want to use. As a solution to this problem and to streamline 
                      the party hosting process, Fiesta would make the process of planning a party easier. With features like creating a guest list, sending invites, 
                      finding a place to host the party, catering services depending on the type of party it is and the host’s budget, Fiesta aims to make your celebration unique. 
                      Fiesta allows the host to make an Amazon Wishlist and share it with everyone invited. Invited guests can decide what to gift from the wish list, 
                      they can RSVP through the web app and get directions to the party location. Hence Fiesta is a one-stop party app.

                      which is a great way to pull up all your "study notes" or "recipes" with a couple of clicks of the mouse. We have been studying and 
                      applying the best user experience in our work.

                      nutrition. This would allow the user to try new and healthier food items. If the user does not have the ingredients. then the user has the option to 
                      have them added to a day They can view the aggregate amounts of consumptions of different ingredients and some suggestions related to their diets. 
                      The list of recipes will be self-updating allowing the user to view new and upcoming recipes

                      Description:
                      Foil maker is a game played between 2 or more people. The game flows as a question is given to all the players and each of them suggest a 
                      possible answer (but not the correct one). The computer shuffles all the answers and adds them along with the correct answer to the list of choices. 
                      This list is presented to all the players and their options are taken. The result is calculated upon the number of players one is successful in 
                      fooling and for getting the correct answer.
                      Server - it is the main controller which controls the flow of game. it implements threads and hence a new object is created for each new player. 
                      The input method does the main task of reading computing and presenting the result. All the player's ids are stored in two array lists for ensuring concurrency.
                      Client - it is the part of code which every player has while playing. It follows MVC format in which every java code has its own model, view and controller. 
                      Model is implemented by the method call; view is defined in the constructor and the controller is given to call1 method.
